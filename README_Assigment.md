# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

This a systematic application of engineering principles methods and tools in development and maintenance of high quality software system

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software Engineering involves is a discline which involves development, testing and deployment. It differs with other programming with essence that it involves writing codes as well as maintaining.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

This is a guideline on how to develope a software

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Requiremts: Gather and document both user and system requirents
Design: Involves creating  detailed design as well as user interface
Implementation: Writing the code according to design
Test: Test to ensure the software meets the quality and requirements
Deployment: Release the software to end user
Maintenance: Offer support such as updates, upgrades

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile involves increamental approach that focuses on collaboration and responding to change while waterfall follws a sequential approach flowing down.
With agile, flexibilty is assured we team involvement and feedback provided, whereas waterfall is best suited when documentation is needed.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

This is the process of designind, developing and maintaining the needs and prefences of a software.
Requirement engineering is importance because it forms basis of feedback for improvements, there is also documentation as well as the scope is well understood.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is the process of diving task into small units with different functions.
It improves maintainability and scalability in that each modules can be tested independently for functionality, differnt teams can work on different modules and combined to form a unit.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing : Testing a unit software on its own
Integration Testing: Is testing how the software integrates with other units
System Testing: Is testing to check the functions of the whole system
Acceptance testing: Acceptaance by the end user, whether it meets requirements and right quality.
Testing is very important to check and fix any fuctional errors, confirms with quality standard and provides room for maintenance.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

These are categorie of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.
Examples: Local Version Control Systems : Storage is basically on a local disc
          Centralized Version Control Systems: globally and every user need to commit for reflecting one’s changes in the repository
          Distributed Version Control Systems :contain multiple repositories

 They are important because they offer room for collaboration and tracking changes made to the source code.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

The main role of Software project manager it to oversee planing, excution and delivery of software projects. He is tasked with resourse allocation, Team leader and ensures quality is quaranteed.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the process of providing necessary support like upgrades, updates, patches etc to a software once it has been deployed.
Maintenance is important to improve user experience, Improve life span and also adapt to changes.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Some of key issues Software engineers face include; Data privacy issue, Conflict of interest,social responsibility as well as accountability.
To adhere to this, Software engineers to have exposure to the following; Training on best practices, Good Code of conduct and also user consent on data privacy.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
